  AfterTextSuccess: "It was her last performance of the night at the Black Box Bar.
    The Jazz Singer crooned out a few sweet notes to the sparse crowd.\r\nThe audience
    in the run-down pub nodded sleepily along. The drink had made them weary and dull.\r\nOnly
    a smatter of applause came from the crowd as the Singer took a bow and the lights
    went down.\r\n"
