  AfterTextSuccess: "In the back room, the Jazz Singer slugged back a drink. \"I'm
    right here,\" she breathed, stepping out from the shadows. \"I trust you have
    my Diamond.\"\r\n\"Of course,\" replied the Burglar, dipping her hand into her
    coat, \"And you have the cash?\"\r\n\"No, but you've served your purpose... You
    brought the diamond right to me,\" grinned the Singer, pressing a gun to the Cat's
    chest.\r\n\"You fool, it's worth nothing without it's Superpositioned double!
    And you'll never know where that one is if you kill me!\" the Cat hissed.\r\n"
